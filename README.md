# Project management for presence project

The presence project is a thermal sensor designed to detect the presence of people.

It is envisaged as a next generation replacement to the current PIR sensors with more advanced configuration options and no requirement for movement as part of the detection. The target market is security and building automation markets.

This project is to track the development of the project. Most of the content will be in the bug report area. Development files such as source code may be released at a future date in independent projects.
